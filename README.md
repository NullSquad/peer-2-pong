## About The Project

This project is a table tennis league dashboard 🏓🚀.

In this project, we use these technologies to provide a streamlined experience for managing a table tennis league. This includes functionalities such as player registration, match scheduling, score tracking, and ranking management 🎲🏆.

User access is managed through the `api.intra.42.fr` API, ensuring secure authentication 🔐🌐. Once users have logged in successfully, they can view the rankings table.

Match details are managed in a CSV file.  📊🗂️.
